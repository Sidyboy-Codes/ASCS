          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            All-Star Charity Shootout (ASCS) is a celebration of Canadian basketball at its best. The event will showcase 20 of Canadaâ€™s most talented
            university, college, and professional basketball stars.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than just a high caliber basketball game, ASCS is an educational experience. This high-profile event uses basketball as a tool to
            create unique and exciting learning experiences that will educate basketball enthusiasts and players about worthwhile charitable causes in
            their communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            For 5 years, ASCS has worked with charities such as Heart and Stroke Foundation, YMCA, Kids Help Phone, War Child Canada, and London
            Children Museum to raise funds and awareness for their local programs.
